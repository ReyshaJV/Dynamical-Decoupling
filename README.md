# Dynamical-Decoupling
CHM69600 Quantum Optics Project

The system considered here consists of two two-level systems that can be driven by a single global laser. There is an interaction between the two TLSs given by $V_0\<ee|ee\>$ where $|e\>$ denotes the excited state of the system. The code simulated a spin echo protocol in a Bloch sphere representation (one for each TLS) and saved it as a video. There is an option to slow down the pulse durations and speed up the interaction to make the dynamics easier to see. There is also a third panel that shows the fidelity with the final expected state. 

I must say that the code was written with a heavy use of AI. Although it was super fun to play with and I'm hoping to continue working on this!
